<h2>I've found my first "bug"</h2>
  <p>
    So, in-between revising, I checked up on the site, and noticed that some code isn't displaying properly. Mainly on mobile devices. This is a shame, and also some of the CSS isn't applied
      to computers using IE9, or IE10. I strongly suggest people update to Chrome, or Safari. But still, it needs fixing. And there's also the small problem of why the code added to the
      misc.html page isn't displaying... Strange
