<h2>Using JavaScript's InnerHTML feature</h2>



<p>
   In case you were never aware, JS has a useful function that enable you to dynamically change the content on a page
    without actually changing pages or reloading the current page. This could be useful as it enables quick refresh of
    text and can be carried out by the user. For example, in an App, why would you want to create seperate pages and
    lots of lines of code, when you could just use several JS buttons that change the content??
    </p>    
<br>
<br>

<p>
   Anyway, here's an example of it at work... 
    </p>

<b id='main'>
<p>
  Hello John Smith!
</p>
</b>

<script type="text/javascript">
function changeText(){
    document.getElementById('main').innerHTML = 'Hello Joe Bloggs! :)<br>';
}
</script>
<input type='button' onclick='changeText()' value='Change Text'/>

    
    

<p>
    As you can see from above the text displayed changed dynamically... And without the page refreshing, and it doesnt have to be displayed in
    bold, I just chose to display it as such so you could see a more noticable change.
    <br>
    As you will be wondering how you achieve such perfection I have, of course, included the code for the example below for you!
    
    </p>


<pre><code>
        
&lt;b id='main'/&gt;
&lt;p/&gt;
  Hello John Smith!
&lt;/p/&gt;
&lt;/b/&gt;

&lt;script type="text/javascript"/&gt;
function changeText(){
    document.getElementById('main').innerHTML = 'Hello Joe Bloggs! :)&lt;br/&gt;';
}
&lt;/script/&gt;
&lt;input type='button' onclick='changeText()' value='Change Text'//&gt;



</code></pre>


<p>
    And thats all there is to it, it works across every browser, and even supports mobile devices...
