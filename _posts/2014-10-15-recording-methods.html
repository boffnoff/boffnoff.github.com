<h2>Various Methods</h2>

<h3>Acoustic Guitar</h3>

<p>
   Use a condenser mic to get a high quality recording.
    <br>
    To take the best reocirding, you need two mics, (each recording on seperate tracks), place one mic around the 12th
    fret. And the other by the bridge of the guitar. Pan both tracks so that they sound better when playing stereo.

<h3>Bass Guitar</h3>

<p>
   Ideally, the bass should be recorded both directly and through an amp at the same time to give you the best sound and tone
    possible.
    <br>
    When recording bass guitar with an amp, the best place for the microphone is 1 foot away from the amp's grill. This
    will give you a solid tone with plenty of body, as well as nice definition of the notes played. Moving the mic further
    away will give you less definition.
    <br>
    You can get good recordings with both caridoid and omnidirectional mics. Directing the mic towards the centre of the cone
    will emphasize the higher frequencies and give you a more aggresive sound. Moving the mic towards
    the speaker's edge gives a softer sound.

<h3>Piano</h3>

<p>
   There are two main ways to setup recording a piano. They vary depedning on what kind of piano you have. But presuming you
    have a Grand Piano, it truly is a minefield. But the best method I have researched is (OR WILL BE PICTRURED BELOW). Where
    you open the top of the Piano and place 3 condenser mics alongside the open side to record the sound as it is produced.
    Simultaneously, another condenser mic should be placed under the Piano to capture the deeper tones of the Piano. One site
    also suggestedd to place a further 2 condensers next to the pianist hands, where they are playing. Setup in an ORTF position
