So, when I first decided to try to create an Arc Reactor LED lamp, the first thing I did was hit the paper
    with some pencil (literally, as I cannot draw!) but my mind soon moved quickly onto bigger things, such
    as using CAD mock up some images of what I hoped that my final outcome may resemble. Alas these images do
    look a lot better than the finished outcome! For this stage I used a program called SolidWorks which is
    renowned for being accurate and perfect for creating high quality images.

I then had to face my fears and realise that if I wanted to make this item then I would actually have to leave
    the PC and enter the real world… For materials I was stuck for ideas… After all I don’t have a bunch of
    missiles in a cave for me to tear apart like Tony Stark did! So I sufficed with just some acrylic, the odd
    strand of metal and some PCB (Printed Circuit Boards + components!)
