## Day 5 already? :(

Somewhow this week has gone way to quickly. I hate the way taht time flies by when you're having fun, because this morning for example we spent 2 hours on walking me through JavaScript basics. For this
we used [JSbin](http://jsbin.com/OruSetU/1/edit), and if you type in the following into the JavaScript window:

### We started with basic number calculations:

    function add(a, b){
      return a + b;
    }
    
    console.log('add', add(5, 7));

This will return the result:
<br>
`"add"`
`12`
<br>
Then I moved onto harder maths, such as subtracting, multiplying and dividing.

###"Scope" (Just like "I See You" in Avatar)

In JavaScript there is something called "Scope" which effects how every object, function and variable behaves and reacts to each other.


function, scope, object literals.
