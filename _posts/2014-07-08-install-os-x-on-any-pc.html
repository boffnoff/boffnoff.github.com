<h2>Install OS X on *any* PC!</h2>



<p>
   Lets presume that you are currently aware that Apple's OS X is the best OS out there.. And that of course you would want a piece of it,
    as who doesnt? Well, now the wonder of OS X can be brought to any PC!! 
    <br>
    As with all things, there are two ways of going about this, the easy way and the hard way. Firstly I'm going to look at the hard way as it's
    more fun. If you wish to skip to the easy section, click <a href="#easy">Here</a>

<p> 
   So intitally for you to install OS X on your computer you are either going to need an official OS disk, (can be purchused from Apple), or a
    Distro. (Distros are modified versions of the offical releases, designed to work on Non-Apple computers. This method I am unsure of, whether
    it is currently legal...)<b>BUT BEFORE YOU PURCHASE ONE, PLESAE CHECK THE SYSTEM SPECS OF YOUR PC AND THE OS REQUIREMENTS</b>
    Once you have obtained a physical copy of the OS - legal or otherwise - you are going to need a PC, lots of time
    and shed loads of patience. Now the bit that really matters.

   Once you have sorted out the correct specs.. (For this tutorial I will be using OS X 10.6.3 as it works on my machine with no hassel)
    Grab a copy of <a href="http://www.tonymacx86.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=39">iBoot</a>. As you will need this in order to boot from
    the retail DVD as it allows your DVD drive to read .iso files as well as OS X's .dmg ones. Enabling you to boot from it and thus install it.
    So once you have burnt the file to disc, insert it into your DVD drive and boot from it, then once it has loaded *INSERT SCREENSHOT* remove
    the DVD and swap it for your Mac one, or iAtkos disc. Then press F5 to refresh the display until you can see a new disc listed, from there
    use the arrow keys to navigate to the disc (From here, this is where you can enter your cusom boot flags)and press enter to boot from it.
