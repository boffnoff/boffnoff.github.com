<h2>Install OS X on *any* PC!</h2>



<p>
   Lets presume that you are currently aware that Apple's OS X is the best OS out there.. And that of course you would want a piece of it,
    as who doesnt? Well, now the wonder of OS X can be brought to any PC!! 
    <br>
    As with all things, there are two ways of going about this, the easy way and the hard way. Firstly I'm going to look at the hard way as it's
    more fun. If you wish to skip to the easy section, click <a href="#easy">Here</a>

<p> 
   So intitally for you to install OS X on your computer you are either going to need an official OS disk, (can be purchused from Apple), or a
    Distro. (Distros are modified versions of the offical releases, designed to work on Non-Apple computers. This method I am unsure of, whether
    it is currently legal...)<b>BUT BEFORE YOU PURCHUSE ONE, PLESAE CHECK THE SYSTEM SPECS OF YOUR PC AND THE OS REQUIREMENTS</b>
    Once you have obtained a physical copy of the OS - legal or otherwise - you are going to need a PC, lots of time
    and shed loads of patience. Now the bit that really matters

    And thats all there is to it, it works across every browser, and even supports mobile devices...
