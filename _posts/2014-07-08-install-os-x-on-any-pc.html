<h2>Install OS X on *any* PC!</h2>



<p>
   Lets presume that you are currently aware that Apple's OS X is the best OS out there.. And that of course you would want a piece of it,
    as who doesnt? Well, now the wonder of OS X can be brought to any PC!! 
    <br>
    As with all things, there are two ways of going about this, the easy way and the hard way. Firstly I'm going to look at the hard way as it's
    more fun. If you wish to skip to the easy section, click <a href="#easy">Here</a>

    </p>    





<p> 
   So intitally for you to install OS X on your computer you are either going to need an official OS disk, (can be purchused from Apple), or a
    Distro. (Distros are modified versions of the offical releases, designed to work on Non-Apple computers. This method I am unsure of, whether
    it is currently legal...)And for this category there are three possible choices, depending on your PC specs. The most popular and well known one is
    iAtkos PRICE: FREE (offering customised bootloaders and system utilites as stock, with every OS X system from Leopard upwards). Secondly, Niresh.
    PRICE: FREE These guys also offer the same features as iAtkos, but for some reason iAtkos is more widely applicable to systems, so it could be
    worth trying both, if one doesn't work for you. And thirdly Kakewalk, however, this option requires access to either an existing Hackintosh or 
    Mac(running OS X 10.6.8 or higher) in order to download the Mac OS. From there you will need to open up the installer and customize the install
    to a 5GB+ USB stick. The only downfall with Kakewalk is that it <b>ONLY</b> supports Gigabyte motherboards. Ideal for those gamers and tech heads,
    but not so for the rest of us.
    <br>
    Personally I recommend iAtkos, as it almost always works straight "out of the box"!
    <br>
    
    <b>BUT BEFORE YOU PURCHASE ONE, PLESAE CHECK THE SYSTEM SPECS OF YOUR PC AND THE OS REQUIREMENTS</b>
    Once you have obtained a physical copy of the OS - legal or otherwise - you are going to need a PC, lots of time
    and shed loads of patience. Now the bit that really matters.

<p>
   Once you have sorted out the correct specs.. (For this tutorial I will be using OS X 10.6.3 as it works on my machine with no hassel)
    Grab a copy of <a href="http://www.tonymacx86.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=39">iBoot</a>. As you will need this in order to boot from
    the retail DVD as it allows your DVD drive to read .iso files as well as OS X's .dmg ones. Enabling you to boot from it and thus install it.
    So once you have burnt the file to disc, insert it into your DVD drive and boot from it, then once it has loaded *INSERT SCREENSHOT* remove
    the DVD and swap it for your Mac one, or iAtkos disc. Then press F5 to refresh the display until you can see a new disc listed, from there
    use the arrow keys to navigate to the disc (From here, this is where you can enter your cusom boot flags)and press enter to boot from it.
