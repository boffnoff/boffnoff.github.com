<h2>WEll, it's a long story</h2>
  <p>
    And I suppose we have as long as it takes... SO, as it's been a while since my last post It's about time I bring you up-to-date
      about the latest changes. Chiefly among which, and perhaps the most noticable will be the "favicon.ico" used for the website.
      The old one was a compressed version of the current wallpaper, where as this one has required some more concentration and
      thought. It has also been designed at 120px by 120px instead of the default 64px by 64px, so that it can also be used as an icon
      on mobile devices.
