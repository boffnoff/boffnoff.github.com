    Day 3. (Wednesday)
</h2>
  <p>
    So Day 3 is already here!! It's 10:10am and the weather has started to pick up, finally. I've logged in, sorted out the various bits of paperwork that needed doing, messed around with the
    title font on the homepage. I tried to embed a font and increase the size of it, because, let's face it it isn't the best nor the biggest. 
    <br>
    So here's what the code looks like now, whether or not you cacn actually view the font is a different matter:
  </p>
<pre><code>
  h1 {
  text-align:center;
  color: #FAFAFA;
  font-size: 90px;
  font-family: 'absender', Arial, sans-serif;
}



@font-face {
	font-family: 'absender';
	src: url('absender.ttf');
	src: local('absender'), local('absender'), url('absender.ttf') format('truetype');
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   We have also decided to sign me up on twitter, so I can be infuenced and have an eye open for what all the 'big shots' are up to. Geeze, even as I created the account I already had one follower! WTF?
