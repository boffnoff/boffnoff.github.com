<h2>Chrome OS</h2>
  <p>
      I recently discovered the wonder of the ChromeBook, and Google's first desktop OS: Chrome. Let me start by saying that unless you want to fork
      out several hundred pounds, you cannot get the Chrome OS. But Hexxah, offers a very good alternative, based around Linux Ubuntu. Although you
      don't need a Google account, when you boot into "Chrome OS", it does help, as it allows for better use and personalisation.
      <br>
      Take note though, it must be installed onto a USB Disk, or run virtually in a VM machine,
      (Check out the <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">free VirtualBox here!</a>) And it can only be used in "Trial More",
      meaning that it cannot

      As you can see from the image, when signed you can access and download apps from Google's extensive Chrome Apps Store, 
      however, if you don't sign in, and just use the "Guest" account, anything you do gets saved in a temporary folder, and on reboot
      will get deleted. So if you plan on using apps etc, and not just browsing the web, it would probably be worth signing in when it asks.

      Another thing worth a mention is that this "Theme" if you will, (As it is not actually Google's Chrome OS) is that it is lightning fast,
      if you currently own a Windows based PC/Laptop, and boot times are ticking over to a minute, you might want to give this a try, on my system
      it took only 28 seconds to boot, a full second quicker than a MacBook Pro, with specs about 4 times better than my own. This system is a speed
      demon, just wanting to be released, released upon the web. It's a shame that it isn't pratical to have the system installed full-time, becasuse
      otherwise I would seriously suggest installing it.

    Personally, on my machine, specs being: 2.2Ghz Dual-Core Intel Celeron, 2GB RAM, it's worth keeping a
