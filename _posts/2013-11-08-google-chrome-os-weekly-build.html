<h2>Chrome OS</h2>
  <p>
      I recently discovered the wonder of the ChromeBook, and Google's first desktop OS: Chrome. Let me start by saying that unless you want to fork
      out several hundred pounds, you cannot get the Chrome OS. But Hexxah, offers a very good alternative, based around Linux Ubuntu. Although you
      don't need a Google account, when you boot into "Chrome OS", it does help, as it allows for better use and personalisation.
