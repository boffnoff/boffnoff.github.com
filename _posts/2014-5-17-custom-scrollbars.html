<h2>How to add custom Scrollbars to your website</h2>



<p>
   When I first stumbled across the whole idea of implementing custom scrollbars to a website, I thought the idea was "cool". Until I realised what a pain
    it was to get it working! However I have warped and chagned the code to get the desired effect, and (fingers crossed) you can still see the changes today,
    regardless of what browser you are using. 
    <br>
    So without further a do, heres how its done, like a Pro. First of all you will need a seperate CSS stylesheet, and embed it into your
    index.html, Exhibit A:
    <br>
    </p>    

    <pre><code>
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="PATH TO CSS STLYESHEET HERE.css"&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    </code></pre>
