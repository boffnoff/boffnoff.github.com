<h2>How to add custom Scrollbars to your website</h2>



<p>
   When I first stumbled across the whole idea of implementing custom scrollbars to a website, I thought the idea was "cool". Until I realised what a pain
    it was to get it working! However I have warped and chagned the code to get the desired effect, and (fingers crossed) you can still see the changes today,
    regardless of what browser you are using. 
    <br>
    So without further a do, heres how its done, like a Pro. First of all you will need a seperate CSS stylesheet, and embed it into your
    index.html, Exhibit A:
    <br>
    </p>    

    <pre><code>
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="PATH TO CSS STLYESHEET HERE.css"&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    </code></pre>
    
<p>
    Where I have said "PATH TO CSS STYLESHEET HERE", insert the actual path to where it is located, so for me it is "css/index.css". Open up the
    file in any plain text editing software, such as Notepad (For Windows) or Text Edit (For Mac). However I suggest that you use 
    <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text Editor.</a>
<br>
    And copy the following code into it... (doesn't matter where)
    </p>

<pre><code>
        
/* CUSTOM WEBPAGE SCROLLBARS ---- IN BETA AND THE CODE ONLY WORKS FOR CHROME ATM, (and Steam in-game browser) */
::-webkit-scrollbar {
    width: 5px;
}

::-webkit-scrollbar-track  {
    -webkit-box-shadow: inset 0 0 6px rgba(255,255,255,0.33333);
    -webkit-border-radius: 10px;
    background: rgba(255,255,255,0.33333);
    border-radius: 10px;
}

::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb  {
    -webkit-border-radius: 10px;
    border-radius: 10px;
    background: rgba(219,221,222,0.7); 
    -webkit-box-shadow: inset 0 0 6px rgba(219,221,222,0.4); 
}
::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb:hover  {
    background: rgba(0,0,0,0.5); 
}

::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb:window-inactive {
    background: rgba(255,255,255,0.33333);
}


</code></pre>
