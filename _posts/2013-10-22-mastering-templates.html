    Day 2. (Tuesday)
  </h2>
    <p>
      It's already 11:30am, gee time flies by when you're having fun! So far today I have delved a little deeper into CSS, added anchor links to the days and am just about to add a HTML JavaScript
      widget into the page.
      <br>
      <br>
    First of all though, this new fandagled CSS I have started. Well it's nothing special like changing the colour of the page. (I think I have done that enough for now!) Does it allow you to press
    a button and magically all of the chores are done? No. But it does mean that I can display code on the website without it screwing up and actually executing the command. I will now have to use
    the code to show you the code. I hope that makes sense. Only it would if it would let me. It doesn't so, here's an image instead.
  </p>
  <img border="0" src="pre_code.png" alt="Pre Code" width="345" height="24">
  
  <pre><code>
   &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;h1 { background: red; }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
   </code></pre>
 
 <p>
   But it is actually do-able, I only realised this later. If you want the "pre code" command to show up, whilst using it, you must encode it using a HTML Entities webiste. Here's the one I
   <a href="http://htmlentities.net">used.</a> SO. In order to display the actual code, I must encode the encoded text again!!! HEADACHES!!!!!! <IMG SRC="http://www.austen.com/tutorial/smiley.gif">
   It's a paradox! Anyway, here's what the above code looks like inside of the "pre code" command.
   </p>
  <pre><code>
    &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;h1 { background: red; }&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;
  </code></pre>
<p>
  Another thing I have maaged to finally get around to doing is inserting anchors for the days, that code goes something along the line of this:
      </p>
  <pre><code>
&lt;a id=&quot;monday&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
