    <p>
        So far I have created a "GitHub" account, a Codio account. And I even managed to complete some JavaScript tutorials on the <a href="http://apple.com/ipad">iPad.</a>
        The plan will be to continue working on this page. I have spent most of my time focused on learing the basics of CSS.
      <br>
      For example:
  </p>
  <pre><code>
    h1 { color: #FFE4E1; }
</code></pre>
  <p>
    This CSS code tells the page that every <code>h1</code> will be the colour (Americans, take a hint, it's spelt with a 'u') #FFE4E1, which happens to be white with a very slight pink tinge. I
    have also learnt how to link an image and set it as the background, (in CSS, and it's a lot easier than HTML) all you have to do is:
  </p>
  <pre><code>
    body 
    {background-image:url('http://gullyborg.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83421dda453ef00e553cf62538834-800wi');
    background-position:center;}
</code></pre>
<p>
  Here the <code>body</code> tells the CSS where it should apply the following code, and all background images should be contained within the body, however if you wanted to preload them, you would
  proabably have a link in the header. The text following <code>backgorund-image:url</code> and inside of the hyphens of the brackets, is a link to wherever the image is stored. Here my example
  is a cute fluffy bunny.
