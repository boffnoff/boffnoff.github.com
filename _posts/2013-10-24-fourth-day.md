## Day 4 is upon us

So the first task ahead of us today is to sort out that pesky "fourth-day.html" file that went AWOL. First task is to clean up index.css, and then to continue working in this new
markdon language. After that I need to add spacing to my headers and style the footers and headers. But since I already have, here's what they look like, firstly the "main_header":

    .main_header {
    padding: 15px;
    border-bottom: solid 3px #00FFFF;
    }


    .page_footer {
    color: silver;
    size: 8px;
    }

As you can see, at least now the website appears a little more professional. The next thing we tackled was a <b>lot</b> more difficult.
