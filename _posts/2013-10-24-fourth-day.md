## Day 4 is upon us

So the first task ahead of us today is to sort out that pesky "fourth-day.html" file that went AWOL.

    h1 {
    <pre> </pre> sdfijdfij
    }doidfjsodifjsd
    
First task is to clean up index.css, and then to continue working in this new markdon language. After that I need to add spacing to my headers and style the footers and headers.
