#Day 3 has dawned, and with it more work
So day 3 is already here!! It's 10:00am and the weather has started to pick up, finally. I've logged in, sorted out the various bits of
paperwork that needed doing, messed around with the title font on the homepage. I tried to embed a font and increase the size of it, because,
lets face it it isnt the best  nor the biggest.
So here's what the code looks like now, whether you can actaully view the font is a different matter:

{% highlight ruby %}
    <pre><code> h1 {
    text-align:center;
    folor: #FAFAFA;
    font-size: 90px;
    font-family: 'absender', Arial, sans-serif;
    }
    @font-face {
    font-family: 'absender';
    src: url('absender.ttf');
    src: local('absender'), local('absender'), url('absender.ttf') format('truetype');
    }
    </code></pre>
{% endhighlight %}

We have also decided to sign me up on twitter, so I can be influenced and have an eye open for what all the 'big shots' are up to. Geeze, even as I
created the account I already had one follower!
I created links to my Twitter page on the "master.html" so that the links appear no-matter what page you are viewing.

The code is as so:

{% highlight ruby %}
    <pre><code>
    &lt;a href=&quot;/index.html&quot;&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;/about.html&quot;&gt;About Me&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/boffnoff&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Boffnoff&quot;&gt;Follow me on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com&quot;&gt;Check out Steam&lt;/a&gt;
    </code></pre>
{% endhighlight %}

As you can probably tell, it's not the most difficult thing I have created so far, but Dave feels that it is neccesary

But it is actually do-able, I only realised this later. If you want the "pre code" command to show up, whilst using it, you must encode it using a
HTML Entities webiste. Here's the one I used. SO. In order to display the actual code, I must encode the encoded text again!!! HEADACHES!!!!!! It's
a paradox! Or Inception, whichever floats your boat. Anyway, here's what the above code looks like inside of the "pre code" command. 

{% highlight ruby %}
     &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;h1 { background: red; }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
{% endhighlight %}

Another thing I have maaged to finally get around to doing is inserting anchors for the days, that code goes something along the line of this: 

{% highlight ruby %}
    <a id="monday"></a>
{% endhighlight %}

#Moving up in the world of server files
And not long afterwards Dave showed me how to understand and impliment the "Templating" idea and way of structuring the filesystems. It involved
creating a new directory called "_layouts" and creating a new file called "master.html" within it. The details within that file currently 
As of 4:12pm, 22/10/13) are: 

{% highlight ruby %}
    <html>
    <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/index.css">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width;">  
    </head>

    <body>
    <h1>My Blog</h1>
    <a href="/about.html">About Me</a>
    <a href="/index.html">Home</a>
    <hr/>

    </body>

    </html>

{% endhighlight %}
