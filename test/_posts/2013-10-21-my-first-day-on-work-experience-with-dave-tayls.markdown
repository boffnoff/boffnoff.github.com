#GitHub
So far I have created a "GitHub" account, a Codio account. And I even managed to complete some JavaScript
tutorials on the iPad. The plan will be to continue working on this page. I have spent most of my time focused on learing the basics of CSS.
For example: 

{% highlight ruby %}
    h1 { color: #FFE4E1; }
{% endhighlight %}

#Here I started to learn the wonders of CSS
This CSS code tells the page that every h1 will be the colour (Americans, take a hint, it's spelt with a 'u') #FFE4E1, which happens to be white
with a very slight pink tinge. I have also learnt how to link an image and set it as the background, (in CSS, and it's a lot easier than HTML) all
you have to do is: 

{% highlight ruby %}
    
    body 
    {background-image:url('http://gullyborg.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83421dda453ef00e553cf62538834-800wi');
    background-position:center;}
{% endhighlight %}

Here the body tells the CSS where it should apply the following code, and all background images should be contained within the body, however if
you wanted to preload them, you would proabably have a link in the header. The text following backgorund-image:url and inside of the hyphens of
the brackets, is a link to wherever the image is stored. Here my example is a cute fluffy bunny.
