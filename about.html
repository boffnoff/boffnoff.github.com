    <h2>Hi, Im Robin Stanley
    </h2>

    <p>
        When I manage to grab some downtime I'm usually found climbing a mountain munching on Jaffa Cakes or grabbing a cheeky covfefe
        <br>
        <br> I specialise in 3D and Motion Graphics, have a passion for minimalism and also work as a freelance Lighting Designer. My knowledge of both areas allows me to seamlessly transition between the CAD and bring those ideas to life.
        <br>
        I am intrigued by the world of project mapping, or 4D projections and have experimented with this to no end. Given enough time, and enough oppurtunities I wish to prove my abilities in this area, by hosting graphics and visuals that will capture the audiences attention. There are a few noteable achievements I am particularly proud of;
        <ul>
            <li>Created, setup hosted and maintained my own NAS</li>
            <li>Programmed a Raspberry Pi to control intellignet lights using the Apple HomeKit protocol. I wish to expand on this and use it to control OSC</li>
            <li>Setup server VM's and am able to debug common Linux, Windows and Mac issues</li>
            <li>Built and networked my own render farm</li>
            <li>6 years experience as an Audio Engineer</li>
            <li>2 years lighting design experience</li>
            <br>
        </ul>
