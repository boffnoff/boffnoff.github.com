  In a galaxy far far away, a long time ago. I once worked with a group of small dwarfs who loved typing up code. They were a small but friendly community of all males, and their hieerachy was arranged
  as so:
  <br>
  Guy with the best/biggest beard is the Alpha Dwarf
  <br>
  The guy with a respectable amount of facial hair is the Alpha Dwarf's right hand man
  <br>
  The guy who wears a pitiful display of stubble is suitable crushed and spat upon by all those lucky enough to have more hair than him.
