    On a dark and stormy night, in a village far far away, Little Red Riding Hood went for a walk to her grandma's house. She decided to bring some oatmeal and raisin cookies (they were her favourite)
    and some hot coffee. For everyone knows that a nice hot bervage is the perfect medicine for anyone who is unfortunate enough to fall ill. But little was Little Red Riding Hood to know, her grandma
    was not ill. Instead she fallen pregnant with a terrible troll child. His name, was so unspeakable, he has been referred to as "He Who Must Not Be Named" throughout time. And it is only as time
    has passed, the rise and fall of kingdoms that once held his power (For he drew his power from fear) that he has become so laughably sick, that he is known now as Robin.
    <br>
    Of course he grew tired of always being the bad guy, and it was after millennias had passed that he chose to join the "Light Side" as it were and become a faithful, law abaiding citizen for now... 
    For years he was feared by those that were once his friends. To avoid  their hateful stares, he changed his name to: "The Chosen One." After only a decade
