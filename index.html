        In a galaxy far far away, a long time ago. I once worked with a group of small dwarfs who loved typing up code.

        So far I have created a "GitHub" account, a Codio account. And I even managed to complete some JavaScript tutorials on the <a href="http://apple.com/ipad">iPad.</a>
        The plan will be to continue working on this page. I have spent most of my time focused on learing the basics of CSS.
  </p>
  <p>For example:</p>
  <pre><code>
    h1 { color: #FFE4E1; }
</code></pre>
  <p>
    This CSS code tells the page that every <code>h1</code> will be the colour (Americans, take a hint, it's spelt with a 'u') #FFE4E1, which happens to be white with a very slight pink tinge. I
    have also learnt how to link an image and set it as the background, (in CSS, and it's a lot easier than HTML) all you have to do is:
  </p>
  <pre><code>
    body 
    {background-image:url('http://gullyborg.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83421dda453ef00e553cf62538834-800wi');
    background-position:center;}
</code></pre>
<p>
  Here the <code>body</code> tells the CSS where it should apply the following code, and all background images should be contained within the body, however if you wanted to preload them, you would
  proabably have a a link in the header. The text following <code>backgorund-image:url</code> and inside of the hyphens of the brackets, is a link to wherever the image is stored. Here my example
  is a cute fluffy bunny.
  </p>
  
  
  
  
     <h2>  <a id="tuesday"></a>
   <div class="days">
    Day 2. (Tuesday)
  </div>    
  </h2>
    <p>
      It's already 11:30am, gee time flies by when you're having fun! So far today I have delved a little deeper into CSS, added anchor links to the days and am just about to add a HTML JavaScript
      widget into the page.
  </p>
  <p>
    First of all though, this new fandagled CSS I have started. Well it's nothing special like changing the colour of the page. (I think I have done that enough for now!) Does it allow you to press
    a button and magically all of the chores are done? No. But it does mean that I can display code on the website without it screwing up and actually executing the command. I will now have to use
    the code to show you the code. I hope that makes sense. Only it would if it would let me. It doesn't so, here's an image instead.
  </p>
  <img border="0" src="pre_code.png" alt="Pre Code" width="345" height="24">
  
  <pre><code>
   &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;h1 { background: red; }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
   </code></pre>
 
 <p>
   But it is actually do-able, I only realised this later. If you want the "pre code" command to show up, whilst using it, you must encode it using a HTML Entities webiste. Here's the one I
   <a href="http://htmlentities.net">used.</a> SO. In order to display the actual code, I must encode the encoded text again!!! HEADACHES!!!!!! â˜¹ It's almost like one of those mirrror mazes at a 
   fairground. Anyway, here's what the above code looks like inside of the "pre code" command.
   </p>
  <pre><code>
    &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;h1 { background: red; }&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;
  </code></pre>
