        In a galaxy far far away, a long time ago. I once worked with a group of small dwarfs who loved typing up code.

        So far I have created a "GitHub" account, a Codio account. And I even managed to complete some JavaScript tutorials on the <a href="http://apple.com/ipad">iPad.</a>
        The plan will be to continue working on this page. I have spent most of my time focused on learing the basics of CSS. For example:
        <br>h1 { color: #FFE4E1; }
        <br>This CSS code tells the page that every "h1" will be the colour (Americans, take a hint, it's spelt with a 'u') #FFE4E1, which happens to be white with a very slight pink tinge. I have also learnt how to link an image and set it as the background, (in CSS, and it's a lot easier than HTML) all you have to do is:
        <br>background-image:url('http://www.insert_link_here.com');
