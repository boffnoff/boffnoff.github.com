<p>
    

As part of my PSHE higher project I am choosing to see if it’s possible to either prove or disprove the existence of a God. In effect another Science vs. Religion argument. 
(Please note that any surrounded with *asterisks* is currently undergoing improvement/research.)



Another question that undoubtedly presents itself, is “How did this religion form, and why?” Because there is not only just one religion that inhabits this world, there are, according to Wikipedia, 21 “major types”. They are:

1. Christianity 2.1 billion
2. Islam 1.3 billion
3. Secular/Irreligious/Agnostic/Atheist 1.1 billion
4. Hinduism 900 million
5. Chinese traditional religion 394 million
6. Buddhism 376 million (see also Buddhism by country)
7. Primal indigenous 300 million
8. African traditional and Diasporas 100 million
9. Sikhism 23 million
10. Juche 19 million
11. Spiritism 15 million
12. Judaism 14 million
13. Baha’i Faith 7 million
14. Jainism 4.2 million
15. Shinto 4 million
16. Cao Dai 4 million
17. Zoroastrianism 2.6 million
18. Tenrikyo 2 million
19. Neopaganism 1 million
20. Unitarian Universalism 800,000
21. Rastafarian movement 600,000

Did Religion merely come into being to fill in the gaps in our scientific understanding? Why is it that Science always has to prove itself to the world by giving us several proofs? Whereas with Religion whenever the Pope or someone infers something different about their religious text, it is instantly accepted. With 1/8 of the population not professing any religion, it begs the question, is there actually a God? And also who do we choose to believe in, our European, western culture that is accustomed to Christianity or do we accept that maybe the eastern culture have it right, and just like the Romans believed in, about the possibility of many Gods existing?


There are many

The main argument to prove His [Christianity’s God] existence is the ‘ontological’ argument. By definition it says that because the world is so complex and so hard to understand, the only logical answer for this must be the fact that it was created by someone: God. The best example for this is the way chemicals are aligned in a strand of DNA. This could be further proved by the “Miller-Urey Experiment”, in which, back in 1953, the two scientists tried to recreate the conditions that would have been present in the Earth’s early primitive atmosphere.

 
They took molecules which were believed to represent the major components of the early Earth's atmosphere (The gases used were methane (CH4), ammonia (NH3), hydrogen (H2), and water (H2O)) and put them into a closed system, and then they electrocuted the compound, to simulate lightning storms believed to be common on the early earth. 

After only one week, they observed that about 15% of the carbon in the mixture had now formed into amino acids: the basic proteins required to make the building blocks of life.

Miller-Urey’s experiment showed that organic compounds such as amino acids, which are essential to cellular life, (organisms that contain cells) could be made easily under the conditions that scientists believed to be present on the early earth. This was brilliant evidence to support the Big Bang Theory, but many other scientists went on to realise that although they had the ingredients, they had no idea what to do with them, or where they put the recipe book. They were and still are as clueless as ever about the miracle that created our world, and the life that inhabits it.

As contradictory as it may seem, through science, we have not only given ourselves evidence to prove “facts”, but to also question ourselves, and present us with another problem. This evidence also adds to the mounting pile of things we don’t understand, and therefore can also be added to the pile of evidence that supports the “Ontological Argument”.



*Include religious arguments against Gods existence, (Both Christian and non-Christian).*


 

Perhaps the most sensible argument from the Bible that lends itself to proving that God doesn’t exist is the fact that if something is already prefect in its current state, there is nothing that is required to make it better. So why would God who is ’perfect’ choose to create something.
This can easily be explained by (www.evilbible.com/Impossible.htm):
What did God do during that eternity before he created everything? If God was all that existed back then, what disturbed the eternal equilibrium and compelled him to create? Was he bored? Was he lonely? God is supposed to be perfect. If something is perfect, it is complete--it needs nothing else. We humans engage in activities because we are pursuing that elusive perfection, because there is disequilibrium caused by a difference between what we are and what we want to be. If God is perfect, there can be no disequilibrium. There is nothing he needs, nothing he desires, and nothing he must or will do. A God who is perfect does nothing except exist. A perfect creator God is impossible.
But Perfection Begets Imperfection; For the sake of argument, let's continue. Let us suppose that this perfect God did create the universe. Humans were the crown of his creation, since they were created in God's image and have the ability to make decisions. However, these humans spoiled the original perfection by choosing to disobey God.
 What!? If something is perfect, nothing imperfect can come from it. Someone once said that bad fruit cannot come from a good tree, and yet this "perfect" God created a "perfect" universe which was rendered imperfect by the "perfect" humans. The ultimate source of imperfection is God. What is perfect cannot become imperfect, so humans must have been created imperfect. What is perfect cannot create anything imperfect, so God must be imperfect to have created these imperfect humans. A perfect God who creates imperfect humans is impossible. 
 

But the Bible doesn’t stop there. It continues to contradict itself throughout:

•	God knows the hearts of men (Acts 1:24 / Ps 139:2,3)
God tries men to find out what is in their heart. (Deut 13.3 / Deut 8.2 / Gen 22:12)

•	God gives freely to those who ask (James 1:5 / Luke 11:10)
God withholds his blessings and protects men from receiving them (John 12:40 / Josh 11:20 / Is 63:17)

•	God is warlike (Ex 15.3 / Is 51:15)
God is peaceful (Rom 15:33 / 1 Cor 14:33)



The above quotes are taken from (http://www.evilbible.com/Biblical%20Contradictions.htm)

By further extension if you look at the “moral precepts” expressed throughout the book we learn that in one instance (Ex 32:27) “killing is commanded” yet in (Ex 20:13) “killing is forbidden”.
This constant state of contradiction creates a smokescreen of confusion that doesn’t help anyone to believe in God, or even to follow this text [The Bible] easily. Proof of this can be supported by the quote “Atheists’ are fools” and “Love thy neighbour”. Two contrasting teachings. Again the idea of discrimination can be reinforced by this quote: “I am the way, the truth and the life. You cannot get to heaven except through me”.


Other such arguments exist; the ‘moral’ merely relies on solid, cold facts. The fact that we have an obligation to follow our morals, and that we are “objectively obligated to do Good and avoid Evil”. So where do these morals come from, we are taught them from our parents, and they from theirs. But societies own code of conduct mirrors that of the ‘religious’ one. So either society (without God/religion) is correct, or perhaps it was the faith in God which founded our rules. However the typical set of conduct does not include anything about “moral obligation”


Here are some of the reasons why people can sometimes convert to becoming religious:
(http://personalitycafe.com/intp-forum-thinkers/3191-10-reasons-why-people-religious.html) 

Times of Desperation and Need

it is much easier to have faith in a religion when you have nothing else. If you are in a time of desperation and need with no hope then you need something to hold on to. If someone is completely satisfied with life then they have no need for a religion because they are content with how they are.

4. Tradition

A lot of people just accept their religion because it is their tradition. Everyone around them follows that religion and no one has done any different for the past 300 years. All the way back to their great great great grandparents their people where following that religion so therefore it feels like they have to follow it too. If you were born in America then you have a great chance that you will be Christian. If you’re from the Middle East then you will most likely be Muslim. If you’re from Asia then you will be Buddhist. You believe that you know 100% truth but yet the simplest thing like being born with parents that had a different belief or being born in a different area would cause your entire belief system to be different.

5. Searching For Answers

People are tired of the lies and deception and they want answers. There are so many unanswered questions that no one can seem to answer and religion puts a bandage on those questions. The truth is that religion creates much more unanswered questions than the ones you had before they are just able to hide them a lot better. If you are looking for answers to life's greatest questions then religion is the worst thing that you can turn to. You must look much deeper than religion and search from within yourself.

6. Guilty Conscious

Some people have made some bad choices in their lifetime and they begin to get a guilty conscious. They can't forgive themselves and so they turn to religion hoping that they will find a God that will forgive them so that they can feel better about themselves. They are also afraid of their karma coming back to haunt them thinking that when they die they will have to face the punishments for what they did in this lifetime.

7. Socializing

For a lot of people the only time that they get to socialize with anyone other than coworkers is when they go to church. They might not even like church that much but they will go just so that they can socialize with people and get out of the house. People also like to feel that they are a part of something and that they belong somewhere.

8. Comfort and Assurance

People like the comfort and assurance that religion creates for them. It makes them feel safe and that everything is going to be alright. They are afraid to step out of their comfort zone and they feel that if they don't have a religion then their life will be chaotic. 

9. Lack of Responsibility

A lot of religious people do not take responsibility for their actions, choices and the world that they create around them. They need something to blame and they need something to send their problems to. I have seen this so many times and it truly saddens me that religion has brought them down so low that they just give up and hope that God will fix it all. How many people have heard someone that is religious say that they can't do something on their own so they leave it in God's hands? "I can't quit smoking on my own, I can't quit drinking on my own, I can't live a happy life on my own, I can't find a good job on my own or live a satisfied fulfilling life on my own so I just put my faith in God knowing that he will do all these things for me." If you want something in your life then YOU need to take action and pursue it. Don't say you can't do something on your own just because you are lazy and lack any willpower.














*Include more / different arguments*




What about the credibility of the other religions, where they believe in several Gods? Surely by the proof of Christianity’s Ontological argument, these other ideas are blown out of the water? Does this make the other religions ‘void’, how can there only be one God, whilst at the same time several hundred exist. Surely this enforces the idea of things becoming lost in translation, obviously the different religious texts originated from different countries but which came first and why? 

Hinduism is considered the oldest religion, (the oldest one that is still practiced anyway); it originated from Northern India, where the “Vedas” were written. They are in effect, the religious texts of Hinduism, or primary texts of it anyway, the first things written about their religion. They were written around 1,500 BC. Whereas Christians religion first formed in 33 AD in Antioch at the Holy Spirit at Pentecost "And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch." (Acts 11:26.)

Surely it only matters what side of the fence you are on                                                                                                                          
	

The problem with the whole idea of God is that: He never left any physical existence on Earth, none of his son’s miracles left any existence, and He has never appeared in modern civilisation e.g. on TV. All historical Gods are imaginary (apparently so according to http://www.godisimaginary.com. And on top of all of this the majority of the Bible has been proven incorrect and therefore by extension not the work of a God, but rather that of earlier primitive humans. 

The following extract is from (http://www.godisimaginary.com/i17.htm)

If one day and I say to you, "I believe in Leprechauns. You cannot prove that Leprechauns do not exist, therefore they exist." You actually have heard of Leprechauns. There are lots of books, movies and fairy tales dealing with Leprechauns. People talk about Leprechauns all the time. Leprechauns even have a popular brand of breakfast cereal. But that does not mean that Leprechauns exist. There is no physical evidence for the existence of Leprechauns. Not a single bit. Therefore, it is obvious to any normal person that Leprechauns are imaginary.



So whenever you point this put to a religious person, the most common reply will be along the lines of: “God is all-powerful and therefore can command others to do his bidding and that he has engineered this as a test of my faith to Him. If people needed to see him in order ti believe it would take away any faith, He must remain hidden.”




























If you believe in God, you have chosen to reject Allah, Vishnu, Buddha, Waheguru and all of the thousands of other gods that other people worship today. It is quite likely that you rejected these other gods without ever looking into their religions or reading their books. You simply absorbed the dominant faith in your home or in the society you grew up in. 

In the same way, the followers of all these other religions have chosen to reject God. You think their gods are imaginary, and they think your God is imaginary. 

In other words, each religious person on earth today arbitrarily rejects thousands of gods as imaginary, many of which he/she has never even heard of, and arbitrarily chooses to "believe" in one of them. 

The following quote from Stephen F. Roberts sums up the situation very nicely: 
"I contend that we are both atheists. I just believe in one fewer god than you do. When you understand why you dismiss all the other possible gods, you will understand why I dismiss yours." 
A rational person rejects all human gods equally, because all of them are equally imaginary. How do we know that they are imaginary? Simply imagine that one of them is real. If one of these thousands of gods were actually real, then his followers would be experiencing real, undeniable benefits. These benefits would be obvious to everyone. The followers of a true god would pray, and their prayers would be answered. The followers of a true god would therefore live longer, have fewer diseases, have lots more money, etc. There would be thousands of statistical markers surrounding the followers of a true god. 

Everyone would notice all of these benefits, and they would gravitate toward this true god. And thus, over the course of several centuries, everyone would be aligned on the one true god. All the other false gods would have fallen by the wayside long ago, and there would be only one religion under the one true god. 

When we look at our world today, we see nothing like that. There are two billion Christians AND there are more than one billion Muslims, and their religions are mutually exclusive. There are thousands of other religions. When you analyse any of them, they all show a remarkable similarity -- there is zero evidence that any of these gods exist. That is how we know that they are all imaginary.
