    <h2>Raspberry Pi</h2>

    <p>
        I am a huge fan of the successful Raspberry Pi. It is small, versitile and easy to use thanks to its linux background. My Pi has been everything from a NAS, a PC, personal cloud, in home streaming device, and even an email server. But that was all childsplay in comparison to my latest venture with the Pi!
        <br> After months of research and painstaking troubleshooting I have setup my Raspberry Pi as and Apple Homebridge device. This allows me using the HomeKit infrastructure to control supported Philips Hue fixtures AND control LEDS directly connected to the GPIO pins. My future plans with this project are to expand it to send and recieve OSC commands so that I am able to use it to control media sources in a live event application.
