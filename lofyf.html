    <h2>Looking Out For Your Future</h2>

    <p>A short theatre piece created by third year drama students at the University Of South Wales. Their performance was centered around the use of technology and wanted a rich viewing experience that was raw with technology to enhance it. I was initially brought onboard as a graphic designer, creating the animations that were projected behind them and onto the floor. At that time they were not sure how to achieve the effects they wished, so I was then tasked with liasing with the technical dept and sorting the techincal side too. This is where my lighting experience came into its own, I created lighting that complemented my graphics, I solved the problem of running the two full HD projectors from one machine using Qlab and on the performance night I ran everything, the video, lighting and audio. <br><br> Unfortunately due to time restrictions some graphics and effects could not be used as they did not have enough time to reheasrse with it. This included more custom graphics that were projected onto perspect handheld sheets to create the illusion of glass touch screen tablets. The idea was to track their movement using a Kinect and touchdesigner software.
    <br>
    That said, I am proud to say that the group achieved a first and narrowly missed out on taking their performance to the Edinborough Fringe Festival!
