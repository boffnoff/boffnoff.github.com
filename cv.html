        Taught myself how to extensively use many of the latest software, and am conversant in many more besides,

            <li>Adobe Creative Cloud Suite, After Effects, Photoshop, Lightroom etc.</li>
            <li>Maxon Cinema 4D</li>

        Worked for the last 3 years at the Wiltshire Music Centre, running the audio for many of their events. On special occasions such as the Bradford Roots Festival I was also running the lighting systems.
