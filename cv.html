    <h2> Homegrown <span style="color: #666">Knowledge</span> </h2>

    <p>
        A few of my most notable achievements; <br>
        I have setup, hosted and maintained my own personal NAS server <br>
        Successfully install MacOS on windows machines, enabling you to use Mac without the hefty price tag <br>
        Am able to upgrade, fix and repair many systems such as: iPhones, Android, Laptops and Desktops <br>
        Setup several Virtual Machines, debugged Linux, Windows and Mac. Is there nothing I cannot do?
        
    </p>
    <p>
        I am intrigued by the world of project mapping, or 4D projections and have experimented with this to no end.
        Given enough time, and enough oppurtunities I wish to prove my abilities in this area, by hosting graphics 
        and visuals that will capture the audiences attention.

        As if that wasn't enough, I have taught myself how to extensively use many of the latest software, and am
        conversant in many more besides, but the following are my main 'go-to' tools:
        <ul>
            <li>Airfoil</li>
            <li>Adobe Creative Cloud Suite, After Effects, Photoshop, Lightroom etc.</li>
            <li>Logic Pro X</li>
            <li>Maxon Cinema 4D</li>
            <li>Unreal Engine</li>
            <li>Xcode</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h2> Audio <span style="color: #666">Engineering</span> </h2>

    <p>
        I have worked for the last 3 years at the Wiltshire Music Centre, providing them with my expertise and knowledge as an
        audio engineer for their more popular events, such as Orchestral Age of Enlightenment, and Bradford Roots. And
        on special occasions such as the Bradford Roots Festival I was also running the lighting systems.
        <br><br>
        Worked at the Clarendon Academy as both an IT technician and an Audio Engineer to run their lighting and sound
        department for their annual school production.

    <p>
        Learnt HTML, CSS and typescript with a two year on and off work experience with
        <a href="https://davetayls.me/">Dave Taylor</a>, I was lucky enough to be able to assist with making some
        of the back-end API's for his new app <a href="http://www.gigstamp.com/">GigStamp</a>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Since January 2017 I have been an active Beta Tester/Moderator/Sounding board/GFX for Ascanio Entertainment's
        action packed installment into the gaming industry: Crash Force. I have been offically recognised for my assistance
        not only in formal writing, but I am also listed in the games credits for my contributions to the games development.
